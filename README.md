# Pizza Sales Analysis
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data using PostgreSQL for data manipulation and Tableau for data visualization. 

The dataset, "Pizza.csv," contains information about pizzas, orders, and sales. 

The analysis covers various aspects, including identifying the best and worst selling pizzas, determining total revenue generated, calculating average revenue, and examining sales trends on various time scales.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes the following columns:

`Pizza_id`: Unique identifier for each pizza.
- `Pizza_name`: Name of the pizza.
- `Order_id`: Unique identifier for each order.
- `Order_date`: Date when the order was placed.
- `Pizza_size`: Size of the pizza.
- `Quantity`: Number of pizzas ordered.
- `Unit_sold`: Price per pizza.
- `Total_unit_sold`: Total revenue generated for each pizza.
- `Order_time`: Timestamp indicating the time of the order.

## SQL Queries Used

The following SQL queries were used to obtain insights from the dataset:

1. **Best and Worst Selling Pizzas:** SQL queries were used to identify the best and worst selling pizzas based on total quantity sold.

2. **Total Revenue Generated:** SQL query calculated the total revenue generated by summing the `Total_unit_sold` for all pizzas.

3. **Average Revenue Generated:** SQL query calculated the average revenue generated per pizza.

4. **Total Number of Pizzas Sold:** SQL query calculated the Total Number of Pizzas Sold.

5. **Average Pizzas per order:** SQL query calculated the Average Pizzas per order.


## Tableau Visualization

Tableau was used to create various visualizations to explore and validate the analysis results:

- **Monthly Sales Trends (Line Chart):** Shows the monthly sales trends over time.

- **Quarterly Sales Analysis (Bar Chart):** Provides a quarterly breakdown of sales.

- **Weekly Sales Overview (Area Chart):** Displays weekly sales fluctuations within a month.

- **Pizza Performance Dashboard (Interactive Doughnut Chart):** Presents the percentage breakdown of pizza sales and individual pizza performance.

- **All-Time High and Low Sales (Gantt Chart):** Identifies historical sales peaks and lows.
